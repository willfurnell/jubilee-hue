# Jubilee Button sample code

This is what I use my Jubilee Line button for - controlling my Philips Hue lights!

This is designed to work with the Jubilee Line button PCB found here: https://github.com/willfurnell/jubilee-button-pcb

This sample code uses the Hue Client from this repository: https://github.com/mnkii/esp32-philips-hue-button.
